This is a module used to add a connect four game to a discord bot.
Usage:
```javascript
var connectfour = require("connectfour-discord")

//...

// the next code needs to be inside your command code (the command to start a game is not included)
// you need to insert players ids and the channel where you want to play the game
var game = new connectfour(player1_id, player2_id, channel)
```
